# OpenCurrent — Static Site (Netlify)

Minimal, professional brochure site for OpenCurrent. Pages:
- `/` — Home
- `/about.html` — Team
- `/contact.html` — Contact (Netlify form)
- `/thanks.html` — Post‑submit

## Quick start
1. Replace team images in `assets/img/` (use square photos).
2. Update text content as needed.
3. Push to GitHub and connect the repo in Netlify → "New site from Git".
4. Enable form notifications in Netlify (Forms → contact → Notifications).

## Notes
- Styling is custom CSS (no frameworks).
- Form is handled by Netlify (no backend required).
- Edit `netlify.toml` as desired.
